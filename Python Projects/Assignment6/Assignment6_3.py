# #Chapter 7 : Files
# Fact 1:
# One important thing is that if the file does not exist, the open command will fail
# with a traceback.

# Fact 2:
# When you are searching through data in a file you're able to select certain parts
#  that fit your condition

# Chapter 9: Dictionaries
# Fact 1:
# Dictionaries are commonly used  to count the occurrence of words within a file with some written
# text

# Fact 2:
# When using dictionaries we would treat capitation sensitively “The” and “the” as different words
#  with different counts.

#  Chapter 10: Tuples
# Fact 1:
# Tuples are immutable, comparable, and hashable so we can sort lists.

# Fact 2:
# Tuples don’t provide methods like sort and reverse, which modify existing lists.
