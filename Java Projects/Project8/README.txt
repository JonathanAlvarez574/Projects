Plot1.java
-Graph one:
-plots the Max time to sort an array at incremented recursion limits up to 300.
-The arrays range in size from 20000 to 10,000,000 at increments of 20000. The
-Graph two:
-Plots the value of which recursion limit produced the Max, so this graph ranges from 2 to 300.

Plot2.java
- Within this class allows for different recursion limits
- and the interval at which to advance the recursion limit that you are evaluating.

LineChart.java
-Creates a JfreeChart for data

FHsort.java
- implement Quick Sort
